# PRODIGY_CyberSecurity_Task01
This project is a simple Python-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the earliest and most basic encryption techniques. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a user-defined number of positions. The script prompts users to enter a message and a shift key, then returns the encrypted or decrypted result accordingly. This task demonstrates fundamental cryptographic concepts and basic Python programming skills, making it a great beginner-level project in the field of cybersecurity.
